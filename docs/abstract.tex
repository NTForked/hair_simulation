\section{Problem Statement}
The paper deals with simulating human hair while accounting for the nonlinear behavior of hair strands with respect to bending and twisting. The paper provides a method for a realistic ans stable  simulation of human hair. 
and twisting

\section{Challenges}
Human hair is a very complex material,
consisting of hundreds of thousands of very thin, inextensible
strands that interact with each other and with the body.
The challenges in modeling hair dynamics are due to the facts that:
\begin{itemize}
\item Each individual strand has a complex nonlinear mechanical behavior,
strongly related to its natural shape: smooth, wavy, curly or fuzzy.
\item The dynamics of an assembly of strands takes on a collective
behavior; however, there is no quantified data
regarding hair clustering and cohesion.
\item There is the issue of computational resources and efficiency that the simulation of a full head of hair would require due to the large number of hair strands involved.
\end{itemize}

\section{Key Ideas}
\begin{itemize}
\item The main idea of the paper is to model a strand of hair as a Super-Helix - a $C^1$
continuous, piecewise helical rod, with an oval to circular cross section. This provides great versatility as it can represent a straight, wavy or curly hair just by adjusting number of pieces in a strand. 
\item This model realistically animates a head full of hair
from only a few hundreds of simulated using 
the local coherence of hair motion by mimicking the collective behavior of hair by
setting up adequate interaction forces between the simulated strands
(Super-Helices) and by adding extra strands at the rendering stage.
\end{itemize}
\section{Result Summary}
\begin{itemize}
\item They reproduced a series of
real experiments on smooth and wavy hair clumps to show that the
model captures the main dynamic features of natural hair like typical nonlinear behavior of hair (buckling, bending-twisting instabilities), as well as the nervousness of curly hair when submitted to high speed motion.
\item They also validated the collective hair behavior
model by comparing the details of the motion of a large real wisp
with that of a simulated hair volume controlled by three guide
strands. Their simulation was able to reproduce closely the motion
and the cohesion between neighboring strands.
\item The model was tested on a 3 GHz Pentium 4 processor. Up to 10
strands can be simulated in real-time. When simulating a full head
of hair, they obtained a mean computational time of
0.3 s to 3 s per frame. 
\end{itemize}
